# Backlog

**From last sprint**
- Character select screen was implemented
- Effects upon item pickups were implemented, along with item spawning


**Backlog for this sprint**
- No originally planned items fell through, though some features are not as fleshed out as they could be.
- PvZ doesn't have a sun economy, though you can still plant peashooters and sunflowers to shoot at the zombies.
  There is also no indicator of where the player is on the grid, so it can be difficult to tell where you are planting plants.
- The AI doesn't attack others, but it doesn't kill itself.
- Attacks could be more unique, but each character at least has a unique set of specials.
