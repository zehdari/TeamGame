Specific comments on what is readable and is not: This file has no message chains, which is a good sign of low
coupling.It doesn't violate the large class code smell as it has less than 100 lines of code. There isn't a while
not done loop, no method has too many parameters, methods are a good length, there are no switch statements,
no inappropriate intimacy going on, follows the one responsibility rule, and is fairly symmetrical with the
other files in the project. There are a few comments that help explain what the code is doing, which helps with
readability. Variable names are descriptive and related.

private list of ten code smells used to check file:
- you don't need it anymore
- while not done loop
- same name different meaning
- switch statements
- too many parameters
- data clumps
- inappropriate intimacy
- large class
- variable name same as type
- asymmetrical code
