## Readability Comments

### Positive Aspects

1. Consistent naming conventions across all systems
2. Clear and logical component checks using HasComponents
3. Clean event handling implementation with descriptive event names
4. Good use of whitespace/indentation
5. Clear stack usage for managing entities in DespawnSystem and ProjectileSpawningSystem

### Areas for Improvement

The code is self-documenting and clear in its intent. No improvements to readability are necessary.
