## Code Smell Analysis

### 1. You Don't Need It Anymore

- All code written has a purpose, so they are always used

### 2. Large Method

- All methods are concise and focused

### 3. Large Class

- The class is over 100 lines of code, however, I believe each line is important and necessary for the system

### 4. Switch Statements

- No switch statements were used in the system

### 5. Data Clumps

- Data is well-organized
- No repeated groups of parameters

### 6. Same Name Different Meaning

- Variable names describe its purpose in the code and helps with understandability

### 7. While Not Done Loop

- No while loops were used

### 8. Too Many Parameters

- Methods did not have an overload of parameters and they were good length or overly complicated

### 9. Asymmetrical Code

- File is slightly larger than most files in the project

### 10. Comments as Smell

- The file has no comments, but the code was readable, so they weren't needed

## Hypothetical Change Analysis

**Proposed Change**: No change so far.

## Conclusion

Everything looks good so far. Great job!
