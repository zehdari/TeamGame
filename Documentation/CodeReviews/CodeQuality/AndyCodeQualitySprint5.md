## Code Smell Analysis

### 1. You Don't Need It Anymore

- All code written has a purpose, so they are always used

### 2. Large Method

- All methods are concise and focused

### 3. Large Class

- The class is not over 100 lines of code, however, which is good

### 4. Switch Statements

- No switch statements were used in the system

### 5. Data Clumps

- Data is well-organized
- No repeated groups of parameters

### 6. Same Name Different Meaning

- Variable names describe its purpose in the code and helps with understandability

### 7. While Not Done Loop

- A while loop is used, but the exit condition is stated

### 8. Too Many Parameters

- Methods did not have an overload of parameters and they were good length or overly complicated

### 9. Asymmetrical Code

- File is fairly symmetrical to other files in the project

### 10. Comments as Smell

- The file has some comments, but the code was readable, so they weren't added to explain complex code

## Hypothetical Change Analysis

**Proposed Change**: No change so far.

## Conclusion

Everything looks good so far. Code was concise. Amazing job!
