# Code Quality Review

**Author**: Cameron  

**Date**: April 19, 2025

**Sprint**: 5

**Files reviewed**: SoundSystem.cs, SoundManager.cs  

**Author of files**: Brendan  

## Code Smell Analysis

### 1. Duplicated Code

- Similar code patterns in `PlayMusic` and `PlaySFX` methods with duplicate instance creation and dictionary operations
- Volume increment/decrement methods have nearly identical implementation patterns

### 2. Large Method

- None of the methods are excessively large

### 3. Large Class

- `SoundManager` is taking on multiple responsibilities (playing, pausing, resuming, and volume control)

### 4. Switch Statements

- None

### 5. Data Clumps

- Not present

### 6. Feature Envy

- Not present - relationship between SoundSystem and SoundManager follows the intended design pattern, where SoundSystem appropriately delegates to SoundManager as a control panel

### 7. Shotgun Surgery

- Adding a new sound operation would require changes in multiple places
- Sound error handling is only implemented in one place (SoundSystem)

### 8. Primitive Obsession

- String keys used throughout instead of a proper enum or type-safe identifiers
- Magic strings in `MAGIC.SOUND` constants
- Direct use of float values for volume instead of a more descriptive structure

### 9. Cyclomatic Complexity

- The try-catch block in `HandleSoundEvent` creates additional paths for code execution
- Dictionary key checks add branching complexity

### 10. Divergent Change

- `SoundManager` handles both music and sound effects, which might need to change independently

## Hypothetical Change Analysis

**Proposed Change**: Add sound fading functionality

The current implementation makes this difficult because:

1. No mechanism exists to track sound transitions
2. The hard stop/start approach in `PlayMusic` doesn't support overlapping sounds
3. Volume controls are discrete rather than continuous
4. `soundEffectInstances` dictionary would need refactoring to track active vs. fading sounds

## Conclusion

The sound system would benefit from refactoring to:

- Use proper enums instead of string constants
- Separate music and SFX management
- Implement better instance management (currently, dictionary keys can collide)
- Add proper disposal of sound instances
- Improve error handling by checking for null references
- Consider implementing sound pooling for frequently used sounds
- Implement the Update method in SoundSystem for time-based operations
