Name of the .cs file being reviewed: GravitySystem
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Peter Eberhard
Specific comments on code quality: Techincally there is duplicated code within the systems in general, not just this one. However, there is not really a way around a loop going through
all entities in each system, unless we want to change our entire structure to have a single system that loops through the entities instead of repeating the same loop in each system, but that seems
unecessary. Other than that, after going through all of my code smells, GravitySystem does not seem to exhibit any other issues.
