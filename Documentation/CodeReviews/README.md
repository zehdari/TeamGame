### Additional Notes

- **Brian's Contribution:** While we're reviewing everyone else's code in these sections, please note that Brian was fully dedicated to working on our sprites during this sprint (which we absolutely loved). His contributions in this area were crucial, even though there isn't a corresponding code review.
- **Brendan's Submission:** Brendan's code wasn't ready until after almost all of the reviews were completed, as he was experiencing issues with Dotnet on a Mac.
