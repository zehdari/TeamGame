## Readability Comments

### Positive Aspects

1. Identifiers are well named - easy to understand their purpose
2. Good spacing within methods

### Areas for Improvement

1. Method names are pretty straight forward, however, it wouldn't hurt to add some comments for each method's functionality
as well as some comments for the procedures in the method bodies.

2. Maybe add another line or two of space in between methods so that they are even easier to differentiate if you are
scrolling through quickly
