## Readability Comments

### Positive Aspects

1. Consistent method naming conventions (Increment/Decrement pattern)
2. Clear organization with focused helper methods
3. Good use of whitespace and indentation
4. Descriptive variable names that convey purpose
5. Helpful comments explaining state management and menu behavior

### Areas for Improvement

1. The `ResetColumnSelection` method exists but is never called
2. Several level menu actions call the same `StartGame()` method without differentiation
3. Multiple early returns in UpdateMenuActive make flow harder to follow
4. Some comments restate the obvious (e.g., "// Get current game state")
5. The stateChangeTimer logic is not immediately obvious in its purpose
