# Readability Review

**Author**: Cameron  

**Date**: April 19, 2025  

**Sprint**: 5
**Files reviewed**: SoundSystem.cs, SoundManager.cs  

**Author of files**: Brendan  

**Time spent**: 25 minutes  

## Readability Comments

### Positive Aspects

1. Clear method naming conventions throughout both files
2. Good organization of related methods (Play/Pause/Stop/Resume)
3. Consistent formatting and indentation
4. Methods are concise and focused on specific tasks

### Areas for Improvement

1. Empty catch block in `HandleSoundEvent` swallows exceptions without logging
2. No clear indication of when sound instances should be disposed
3. The `using ;` directive is unusual and likely incomplete
4. The `Initialize` method of `SoundManager` immediately plays music without clear indication why

The code would be more readable with proper documentation, stronger typing, and clearer error handling patterns.
