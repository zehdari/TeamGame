## Readability Comments

### Positive Aspects

- Most variables are appropriately named
- Whitespace is used appropriately
- All indentations are there

### Areas for Improvement

- Some of the naming conventions in LevelLoader for the methods can get a bit confusing (MakeEntity vs makeEntity)
- A couple comments may be a bit redundant, but they don't intrude or distract from the code
