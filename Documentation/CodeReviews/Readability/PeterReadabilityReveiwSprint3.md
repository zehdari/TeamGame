## Readability Comments

### Positive Aspects

1. This is a very short method so inheranly pretty readable
2. The addition of having a default spawn makes intuitive sense

### Areas for Improvement

I know the code is already readable so comments feel like a waste but I like being able to tell immidiatly what the author was thinking, so just one or two comments in the method would be nice.
