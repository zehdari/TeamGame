## Readability Comments

### Positive Aspects

I was assigned to reveiw for Katya who spent this sprint designing new levels using our level loader which makes readability quite good consider all the files are json.

### Areas for Improvement

In spawnpoints it's a little unclear what the numbers are refering to other than just vague "spawnpoints" Maybe we could change the parser to make it clearer?
