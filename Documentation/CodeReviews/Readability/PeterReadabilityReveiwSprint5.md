## Readability Comments

### Positive Aspects

This code is quite well commented considering how rushed i know we got it out. I is very readable overall

### Areas for Improvement

Huge Nitpick but having the 1 line functions mixed in makes it a bit harder to sort through methods, maybe we could put them at the top?
