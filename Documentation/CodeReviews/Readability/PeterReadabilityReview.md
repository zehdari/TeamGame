## Readability Comments

### Positive Aspects

1. The code is largely very readable, particularly the second half.

### Areas for Improvement

1. The update loop took a moment to understand and required reading another file; a brief comment explaining its purpose would be helpful.  
2. Although the use of the bool `Pausible` is somewhat intuitive, a short comment explaining its purpose would assist in future maintenance.
