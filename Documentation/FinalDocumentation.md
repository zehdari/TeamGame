Movement/Player Functionality- Have several moving characters, e.g., a plant character that can run, jump, and attack.
Enemies- Could be substituted for the other player you’re playing against. If not, we can make an AI character that you can fight.
Player controls – Goal at the end is to be able to control the player with a gamecube controller.
State changes – Players can take damage, be midair, and face different directions. Players will also receive power-ups later.
Projectiles – Some characters will be able to shoot out projectiles, e.g. a peashooter shoots a pea.
