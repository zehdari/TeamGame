# Known Bugs (or features)

**Bugs**


**Features**
- The menu has a limit on how fast you can flip through it. This was to help control it with a gamepad, though it may feel slow and unresponsive on keyboard. 
- Player can jump after ***walking*** off of the map. Think Wiley Coyote.
- Peas go through the level. Might be a bit bad for game balance, but it's fun to snipe people as peashooter.
- You can start a level with 0 players selected. This was intended as a level preview, and you can still go back to the main menu by pausing and selecting main menu.
