# Known Bugs (or features)

**Bugs**
- When selecting the PVZ level from the level select, it assumes that no characters will be selected, though there is no indication in the menu.
  This will not crash the game, though it will result in an unintended win screen when only one character remains.

**Features**
- The menu has a limit on how fast you can flip through it. This was to help control it with a gamepad, though it may feel slow and unresponsive on keyboard. 
- Player can jump after ***walking*** off of the map. Think Wiley Coyote.
- Peas go through the level. Might be a bit bad for game balance, but it's fun to snipe people as peashooter.
- You can start a level with 0 players selected. This was intended as a level preview, and you can still go back to the main menu by pausing and selecting main menu.
