---

## Primary Plans
### More Characters (2)###
	- Chomper
	- Zombie
	
### Even More Levels
	- Night Roof
	- Pool
	- Night Pool (w/ fog?)
	
### Competent AI
	- Tracks player
	- Doesn't run off of the edge
	- Actually tries to fight
	
### More complex attacks
	- Directional: up, down, left, right
	- Two modes: normal/special
	- Total of ~8 attacks per player
	
### Level Hazards
	- Moving platforms
	- Traps (e.g. chimney blowing smoke and acting like a geyser)

## Backlog
### Character Select Screen
	- Allows each player to select their character
	- Allows players to select which characters to play against
		- AI difficulty level is a wishlist item
		
### Effects (Slows, burn, poison, etc)
	- Some attacks should apply debuffs

## Other Possibilities (time permitting)
### Level of Plants Vs. Zombies 
	- Will reuse current plant and zombie sprites, just with different behavior
	- Grid system to control plant placement and zombie spawning

### Grabs 
	- In smash, characters can grab ahold of other players and throw them
